# memrise-userscripts

Some [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) scripts for [Memrise](http://memrise.com):

* **Make Me Type**: replace multiple-choice questions with typing questions.
* **Randomize Styles**: randomizes the look and feel of a Memrise quiz because I _think_ that might be better for memory (not sure).

So you don't have to keep installing the scripts, you can make symlinks to them in this directory (replace as necessary):

/Users/\$YOU/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/\$PROFILE/gm_scripts/

You can then symlink that directory here.
